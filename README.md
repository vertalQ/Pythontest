# MY PYTHON REPO
This is a test for the Python extension set up in VScode.

## Test Python Files.

There are files that I have either programmed or used from others to test python and learn python features.
To access them, you must:

1. Go to 'Beginner Projects' directory.
2. Select desired directory.
